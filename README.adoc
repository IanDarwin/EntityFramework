== EntityFramework

This intends to be somewhat of a drop-in replacement for the Seam2 Entity Framework.

Current status is: broken. It compiles but doesn't run, due to issues with datasources.

Some of this work may have been done at the Centre for Global eHealth Innovation (ehealthinnovation.org),
based on my years of experience with Seam2 and JPA at previous engagements.
