== EntityFramework

This intends to be somewhat of a drop-in replacement for the Seam2 Entity Framework.

It works for adding entities using the Home object, and listing all the entities of a given class
using the List object. See the TODO file for why this is not enough.

Some of this work may have been done at the Centre for Global eHealth Innovation (ehealthinnovation.org),
based on my years of experience with Seam2 and JPA at previous engagements.
